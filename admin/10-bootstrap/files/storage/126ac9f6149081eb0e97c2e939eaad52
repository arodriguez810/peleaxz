Node takes the event model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library. In other systems there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop. Typically behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script and at the end starts a server through a blocking call like EventMachine::run(). In Node there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like browser JavaScript — the event loop is hidden from the user.\n\n","topic":"Development","userID":{"_id":"5babf1a11c224700154671c4","userName":"User Test","avatar":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lrodriguezcastro/image/upload/v1537995169/blogbox/kf0aaj2whkobvzwpwsss.png"},"date":"Sep 27th 2018, 6:43:20 pm","__v":0,"comments":[{"_id":"5c996d806c904c0015855560","updatedAt":"2019-03-26T00:08:32.354Z","createdAt":"2019-03-26T00:08:32.354Z","body":"Nice blog!!","blogID":"5bad24c856d5ab0015166be8","userID":"5c996d626c904c001585555e","email":"user_luis@example.com","name":"rodriguezcoding","date":"Mar 26th 2019, 12:08:32 am","__v":0,"subComments":[]},{"_id":"5c996e306c904c0015855562","updatedAt":"2019-03-26T00:11:28.194Z","createdAt":"2019-03-26T00:11:28.194Z","body":"gg","blogID":"5bad24c856d5ab0015166be8","userID":"5c996e136c904c0015855561","email":"luis@example.com","name":"rodriguezcoding","date":"Mar 26th 2019, 12:11:28 am","__v":0,"subComments":[]}]},{"_id":"5bae67cc7f7ece001565b6eb","updatedAt":"2018-10-02T04:12:03.692Z","createdAt":"2018-09-28T17:41:32.706Z","title":"I love puppies.","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lrodriguezcastro/image/upload/v1538156530/blogbox/wdhjuwaajlxjipigmtvw.jpg","likes":0,"article":"Playing with puppies is good for the soul.","topic":"that dog life","userID":{"_id":"5bae67b37f7ece001565b6ea","userName":"jim","avatar":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lrodriguezcastro/image/upload/v1538156466/blogbox/bjpjgjbqgtrejcsxkv2d.jpg"},"date":"Sep 28th 2018, 5:41:32 pm","__v":0,"comments":[{"_id":"5bae68087f7ece001565b6ed","updatedAt":"2018-09-28T17:42:32.032Z","createdAt":"2018-09-28T17:42:32.032Z","body":"who loves puppies like I do?","blogID":"5bae67cc7f7ece001565b6eb","userID":"5bae67b37f7ece001565b6ea","email":"jim@jim.com","name":"jim","date":"Sep 28th 2018, 5:42:32 pm","__v":0,"subComments":[]},{"_id":"5bb2f013bda65b00150e1785","updatedAt":"2018-10-02T04:12:03.707Z","createdAt":"2018-10-02T04:12:03.707Z","body":"I like puppies too lol.","blogID":"5bae67cc7f7ece001565b6eb","userID":"5babf0f41c224700154671c2","email":"luis@gmail.com","name":"Luis Rodriguez","date":"Oct 2nd 2018, 4:12:03 am","__v":0,"subComments":[]}]}],"ttl":1561475603405}
